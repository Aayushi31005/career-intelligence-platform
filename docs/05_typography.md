# Typography

Typography plays a critical role in shaping how users perceive information and interact with the platform. Since the product is designed for prolonged use during cognitively demanding tasks, typography choices prioritize readability, neutrality, and visual calm.

The typography system is intentionally simple to reduce distraction and support clear information hierarchy.

---

## Design Intent

- Ensure high readability across long sessions
- Minimize cognitive fatigue
- Maintain a professional and neutral tone
- Support clear visual hierarchy without relying on color alone

---

## Font Selection

### Primary Typeface

**Font:** Inter  

**Usage:**  
- Body text  
- Labels  
- Descriptive content  
- Secondary headings  

**Rationale:**  
Inter is designed specifically for screen readability. Its neutral appearance and generous spacing make it suitable for dense information without feeling overwhelming.

---

### Secondary Typeface (Optional)

**Font:** DM Sans  

**Usage:**  
- Primary headings  
- Section titles  

**Rationale:**  
DM Sans adds a subtle sense of warmth and approachability while maintaining clarity. It should be used sparingly to avoid visual noise.

If a single typeface system is preferred, Inter alone is sufficient.

## Typographic Hierarchy

The platform follows a clear and consistent hierarchy:

- **H1:** Page titles and primary section headers  
- **H2:** Section headings  
- **H3:** Subsections and grouped content  
- **Body text:** Core explanatory content  
- **Caption text:** Supporting or contextual information  

Hierarchy should be communicated through size, weight, and spacing rather than color alone.

---

## Font Weights

- Headings: Medium to Semi-Bold  
- Body text: Regular  
- Emphasis: Medium (avoid heavy bolding)

Excessive use of bold text should be avoided, as it increases visual tension.

---

## Line Height and Spacing

- Body text line height: 1.5–1.7  
- Headings should include generous spacing above and below
- Paragraphs should not appear cramped

Proper spacing is as important as font choice for readability.

---

## Text Alignment

- Left-aligned text is the default
- Center-aligned text should be used sparingly (e.g., empty states or summaries)
- Justified text should be avoided due to uneven spacing

---

## Tone and Language Considerations

Typography supports not only readability but also emotional tone.

- Avoid all-caps for long text
- Use sentence case for most labels and headings
- Prefer clear, simple language over technical jargon where possible

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- Text sizes should be scalable without breaking layout
- Sufficient contrast must be maintained between text and background
- Font choices should remain legible at smaller sizes

---

## Closing Note

This typography system is designed to fade into the background, allowing users to focus on understanding insights and making decisions. It prioritizes clarity and comfort over stylistic expression.
