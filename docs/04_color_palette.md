# Color Palette

The color palette of this platform is designed to reduce stress, improve focus, and convey trust. Since users often interact with the product during periods of uncertainty or pressure, color choices prioritize calmness, readability, and emotional safety over visual intensity.

The palette is intentionally minimal and structured to support consistency across the application.

## Design Intent

- Reduce cognitive and emotional load
- Create a calm and professional atmosphere
- Maintain strong readability for long sessions
- Support visual hierarchy without harsh contrast

Blue is chosen as the primary color family due to its strong association with clarity, trust, and calmness.

## Core Color System

### 1. Primary Background Color

**Purpose:**  
Used as the main page background to provide a soft, non-distracting canvas.

- Color: Very light blue / blue-tinted white  
- Example: `#F4F8FB`

**Rationale:**  
This color minimizes eye strain and prevents the interface from feeling stark or clinical.

### 2. Secondary Surface Color

**Purpose:**  
Used for cards, panels, containers, and grouped sections.

- Color: Soft muted blue  
- Example: `#E6F0FA`

**Rationale:**  
Creates gentle separation between sections without strong visual boundaries.

### 3. Primary Accent Color

**Purpose:**  
Used for primary actions, key highlights, progress indicators, and important links.

- Color: Calm deep blue  
- Example: `#2F6DB5`

**Rationale:**  
Provides confidence and emphasis without appearing aggressive or urgent.

### 4. Supporting Accent Color (Optional)

**Purpose:**  
Used sparingly for success states, paths, and secondary highlights.

- Color: Soft teal-blue  
- Example: `#4FA3A5`

**Rationale:**  
Adds visual variety and warmth while remaining within the calming color spectrum.

## Text Colors

- Primary text: Dark neutral (e.g., `#1F2933`)
- Secondary text: Muted gray-blue (e.g., `#6B7280`)
- Disabled or hint text: Light gray-blue (e.g., `#9CA3AF`)

Text colors are selected to ensure high contrast and readability across all background surfaces.

## Color Usage Guidelines

- Backgrounds should remain light to avoid visual fatigue.
- Accent colors should be used intentionally and sparingly.
- Color should never be the sole indicator of meaning.
- Error and warning states should use softened tones rather than harsh reds.
- No screen should rely on high-saturation colors for extended viewing.

---

## Theming and Personalization

The platform supports user-selectable themes from a curated set of predefined palettes.

- Themes modify background and accent colors only.
- Semantic meaning (success, warning, error) remains consistent across themes.
- Unrestricted color customization is intentionally not supported to preserve accessibility and design coherence.

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- All color combinations are chosen to meet basic contrast guidelines.
- Visual hierarchy relies on spacing and typography in addition to color.
- Users with visual sensitivities should be able to interact comfortably with the interface.

## Closing Note

This palette is intentionally conservative. It prioritizes emotional comfort, clarity, and long-term usability over visual novelty. Any additional colors introduced in the future must align with this philosophy.
