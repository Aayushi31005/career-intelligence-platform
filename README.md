# Career Intelligence Platform

A career intelligence and decision-support web application that helps tech professionals gain clarity on skills, readiness, role alignment, and networking direction through explainable, data-driven insights.

## What This Project Does

The Career Intelligence Platform is designed to support **career decision-making**, not automate hiring or outreach.

It helps users:
- understand skill gaps for target roles,
- assess resume alignment in an explainable way,
- identify roles they are ready for now vs later,
- discover curated learning resources,
- and plan intentional networking paths using relationship-based logic.

## Core Features

- **Skill Gap Analyzer** – identifies missing and priority skills using job market signals  
- **ATS Readiness Estimator (Heuristic)** – explainable resume-to-role alignment  
- **Job-to-Profile Matching** – categorizes roles as strong fit, near fit, or long-term target  
- **Learning Resource Recommender** – maps skill gaps to curated learning resources  
- **Network Path Finder** – models professional connections as a graph to suggest meaningful networking paths  

## Design Philosophy

- Calm, non-judgmental user experience  
- Explainable logic over black-box predictions  
- Ethical scope and transparent limitations  
- Independent tools (users choose what they need)

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript  
- Backend: Python, FastAPI  
- Graph Logic: NetworkX  
- Data: Curated & synthetic datasets  

## Project Status
